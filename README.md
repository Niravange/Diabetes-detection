Diabetes detection employing machine learning methodology based on age, sex, BMI, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measures of patients, as well as disease development during a one-year period following baseline. Comparative analysis of different classifiers such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayesian (GNB) is presented in this study. The purpose of this research is to create a model that can accurately predict the risk of diabetes in people. Precision, Accuracy, F-Measure, and Recall are all used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
